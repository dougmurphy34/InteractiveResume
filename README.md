# InteractiveResume
Doug's Interactive Resume project, written in Django, deployed on Heroku

I'm a web developer.  This is the source code for my Interactive Resume project, hosted at http://irf.herokuapp.com.  
It contains all the information in my resume, and displays it using the type of web technologies I use as a web 
developer.  It is intended to simultaneously tell you what I can do, and show you.

This project uses HTML5, CSS, Django, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Angular.js, postgresql, and a variety of other 
technologies.
